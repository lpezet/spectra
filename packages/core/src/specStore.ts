/**
 * The storage seam for the glossary (GH #3).
 *
 * It lives in `@abseed/spectra-core`, the pure package, on purpose: this interface is the stable public
 * boundary an out-of-repo store implements, and an implementor should depend on it without pulling
 * in a server's Express/agent machinery. It references only domain types (from `./types.js` and
 * `./schema.js`), so it belongs with them. The built-in filesystem and SQL backends live in
 * `@abseed/spectra-server`; a hosted/networked backend is just another implementation of this contract.
 *
 * Why this exists: specs are a shared human artifact, not a byproduct of the code. To make
 * them centrally visible to a team (and later multi-tenant/hosted), the content of `specs/`
 * has to be able to live somewhere other than the local filesystem. This interface is the
 * one place that decides *where*; `FileSystemSpecStore` (today's behaviour) and a future
 * `SqlSpecStore` are peers behind it. "Hosted" is a deployment axis, not a third backend.
 *
 * The boundary, stated so we do not blur it:
 *   - SpecStore is PERSISTENCE ONLY — reads, id allocation, and writes. Domain logic stays
 *     in the caller: the changeset engine (`applyOps`), validation (`parseTerm`/…),
 *     diagnostics, and version-guard decisions all remain in commit.ts / propose.ts /
 *     answer.ts / raise.ts / expectations.ts, which compose a SpecStore rather than living
 *     inside it.
 *   - Records are addressed by DOMAIN ID (`term.name`, `changeset.id`, `q-…`, `e-…`). No
 *     filename or path is used to *address* anything — the FS impl keeps its id→file map
 *     private, which is what lets a SQL row id stand in with no change to the caller. The one
 *     value that crosses the line is `StoredAt`, returned by the create methods purely so the
 *     caller can echo "where it landed" in a response; it is opaque and never parsed.
 *   - STATE IS DATA, NOT LOCATION. Today "applied" means a file sits in `applied/` and
 *     "retired" means it sits in `retired/`; here those are state transitions named as
 *     methods. The reads still return the partitioned view; only the FS impl backs it with
 *     folders.
 *   - `problems` survives: a record that will not load is reported, not thrown. It is an FS
 *     truth today (hand-edited files) but an API backend can return partial data too. What
 *     does NOT survive is "re-read from disk every call" — that is an FS detail.
 *
 * Optimistic concurrency (GH #93): a changeset is computed against the glossary as the reviewer saw
 * it, but applied later — possibly after someone else applied first. `commitApplication` takes an
 * optional `baseVersion` (a {@link glossaryVersion} token) and compare-and-swaps on it: the write
 * lands only if the glossary is still at that version, else it returns a {@link CommitConflict} and
 * writes nothing. Absent `baseVersion` keeps the old last-write-wins behaviour, so existing callers
 * and single-writer deployments are unaffected. The token is derived from the terms (not a stored
 * `version()` method), so it always matches the terms a caller just read.
 *
 * Not in scope: `data/transcripts.db` (chat history, its own store) and the offline snapshot /
 * `specs.snapshot.json` version guard (that is `specsSnapshot`, terms + expectations, for the
 * mark_implemented drift check — a different token for a different job).
