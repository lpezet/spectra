/**
 * An out-of-process agent runtime — the entry point.
 *
 * Runs one agent's loop as a standalone service. It is written once and serves *either* agent —
 * `AGENT` selects which (`coder` by default; `spec` for the spec runtime). It holds its own identity
 * nowhere: the loop ({@link ./engine.ts}) fetches its profile (prompt, builtins, tools) from the
 * Server's `/mcp/<agent>/profile` per run, so who it is comes from the one definition in the Server,
 * not a copy in here. `@coder` runs next to the code it edits inside a container that can write only
 * its `APP_DIR`; `@spec` has no filesystem tools at all and just needs a cwd to exist. Either way
 * this holds no transcript — the record belongs with the specs, and a box you can delete and rebuild
 * should not be where anything is kept.
 *
 * This file is now only wiring: read the environment, build the engine, and start a transport. The
 * loop lives in {@link ./engine.ts}; the two transports in {@link ./httpTransport.ts} and
 * {@link ./attachTransport.ts}. `MODE` picks which:
 *   - `serve` (default) — an HTTP service a coordinator on the same network dials into. Unchanged.
 *   - `attach` — dials *out* to a coordinator this runtime cannot be reached from (behind NAT),
 *     over one WebSocket. Needs `COORDINATOR_URL` and a `DEVICE_TOKEN`.

 * Where the glossary lives — a URL now, not a mount.
 *
 * This service used to read `/work/specs` from a read-only bind mount through its own copy of the
 * reader. Two problems, and the second is the real one: the copy had drifted from the spec tool's,
 * and a mount can only ever offer *reading* — writes to the glossary (raising a question, marking a
 * changeset implemented) were impossible from here. Over a tool call they are two capabilities,
 * granted individually, executed by the process that owns `specs/` and can refuse.
 *
 * `SERVER_URL` points at the Server (the coordinator). `SPEC_URL` is the old name for it and is
 * still read as a fallback, so a compose file from before the spec→server rename keeps working.
