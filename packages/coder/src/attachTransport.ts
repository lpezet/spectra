/**
 * The runtime as an outbound client that *dials a coordinator* — the mirror image of
 * {@link ./httpTransport.ts}.
 *
 * The HTTP transport works because the coordinator can reach the runtime: it sits on the same
 * network and dials in. When the runtime runs on a machine the coordinator *cannot* reach — behind
 * NAT, no inbound port, no public address — that inverts: the runtime must dial out. And a single
 * connection the runtime opened still has to carry the coordinator's pushes back down it (turns,
 * approval decisions), which request/response HTTP cannot do. So this is one bidirectional
 * WebSocket, carrying the same three verbs the HTTP routes carried, multiplexed by `sessionId`.
 *
 * It is deliberately coordinator-agnostic: it is handed a URL and a device token and speaks the
 * frames below to whatever answers. It knows nothing about who runs the coordinator or where.
 *
 * ── Wire frames (one JSON object per WebSocket text message: `{ t, sessionId?, ... }`) ───────────
 *
 * Runtime → coordinator (this side sends):
 *   hello              { runtime, version, token }        first frame; authenticates the socket
 *   delta              { sessionId, text }                live typing, ephemeral (never persisted)
 *   assistant          { sessionId, text }                a completed assistant message
 *   tool_call          { sessionId, id, tool, input }     a tool invocation began
 *   tool_result        { sessionId, id, isError, content }a tool invocation settled
 *   approval           { sessionId, approvalId, tool, input }  a run is blocked awaiting a decision
 *   auto_approved      { sessionId, approvalId, tool, input }  allowed without asking (unattended)
 *   approval_expired   { sessionId, approvalId }          nobody answered in time; treated as deny
 *   error              { sessionId, text }                a run-level failure (incl. a busy turn)
 *   done               { sessionId }                      the turn finished
 *   pong               { }                                reply to a ping
 *
 * Coordinator → runtime (this side receives):
 *   turn               { sessionId, prompt, unattended? } start a turn
 *   decision           { approvalId, decision, note? }    deliver a human's approval decision
 *   ping               { }                                keepalive
 *
 * Every upstream event but `hello`/`pong` is exactly what the engine emits, re-tagged `t = kind`
 * and stamped with the `sessionId` it belongs to — the identical vocabulary the HTTP stream sends,
 * so a coordinator records a relayed turn the same way whichever transport carried it.
 *
 * Reconnect: on a drop the socket is re-dialed with capped backoff. Subscriptions to the engine's
 * per-session emitters are kept across reconnects, so a turn in flight resumes streaming to the new
 * socket; only events emitted during the actual gap are lost (the emitter does not buffer — the same
 * property the HTTP SSE stream already has). Durable rows are the coordinator's to replay from its
 * own store, not this runtime's to re-send.
