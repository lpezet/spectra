/**
 * The drift check itself — "do the glossary and the code still agree?" — as pure findings.
 *
 * Kept framework-agnostic on purpose: it returns a list of problems rather than asserting, so a
 * consumer project turns it into a one-line test in whatever runner it already uses (see the README).
 * Empty list means the code and the committed snapshot are in sync.
 *
 * It checks two correspondences, symmetrically:
 *
 * - **Terms ↔ code.** A malformed `implements:` marker, a marker naming a term the glossary no longer
 *   has, and a term (entity/function/event) nothing implements.
 * - **Expectations ↔ tests (GH #96).** A malformed `verifies:` marker, a marker naming an expectation
 *   the glossary no longer has, and a *functional* expectation no test verifies. Non-functional
 *   expectations are exempt — they are properties of a running build, checked by driving it, not by a
 *   test phrased in glossary vocabulary.
 *
 * What it deliberately cannot catch: a term whose *spec was rewritten*, or an expectation whose
 * *wording changed* — the marker still names it and still looks right. That is what the per-term and
 * per-expectation `hash` in the snapshot is for: refreshing the file makes `git diff
 * specs.snapshot.json` name what moved, so the check fails loud for structure and review catches the
 * rest.
