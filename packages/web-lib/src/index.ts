/**
 * `@abseed/spectra-web-lib` — the reusable half of the spec-tool UI: the presentational components,
 * the transport-injected glossary behavior (`useGlossary`), the chat subsystem, and the styles.
 *
 * A host builds its own shell — layout, routing, auth, the marketing pages a product grows — and
 * composes these pieces into it, injecting its own `GlossaryTransport` (and, for chat's live half, a
 * `ChatTransport` via `setChatTransport`). The local tool's shell in `@abseed/spectra-web` is one such
 * host; it drives everything against same-origin REST. Nothing here reaches a `fetch` of its own: the
 * behavior depends only on the `GlossaryTransport` interface, so the same flows run against any backend.
 *
 * Importing this pulls the styles in as a side effect, so a consumer gets the styled UI from one import.
