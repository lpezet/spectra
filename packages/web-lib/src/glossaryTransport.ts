/**
 * The seam that makes the glossary *behavior* portable: the data contracts and the operations the UI
 * performs, as an interface — not as `fetch` calls.
 *
 * `useGlossary` (the orchestration: loading, the commit/answer/expectation flows) depends on this
 * interface and nothing else, so the same behavior runs against any backend that implements it. The
 * local tool implements it with same-origin REST (`apiTransport` in `api.ts`); a different host — one
 * that drives the agents over its own wire — implements it its own way and reuses the identical hook.
 *
 * This is deliberately the *glossary* transport, not the chat one: chat has its own injected seam
 * (`setChatTransport` in `chat.ts`). Keeping the two apart is what lets a host swap either without the
 * other. The types here are the published contract, so they live beside the interface rather than in
 * the REST module that happens to implement it today.
