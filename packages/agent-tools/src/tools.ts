/**
 * The agent's tool surface — the pure, transport-agnostic half.
 *
 * These are domain tools, not file tools, and that is the whole point. The human write path is
 * changesets-only; if the agent had `Write` on the glossary it could edit a term directly and the
 * discipline would rest on the system prompt asking it not to. Here it rests on there being no such
 * tool. The agent physically cannot bypass review.
 *
 * WHY this is its own package, not `@abseed/spectra-core`: these schemas are consumed by the agent SDK,
 * which peer-requires zod 4, while core is zod 3. So the tool definitions live here (zod 4, no node
 * builtins, no SDK dependency) where both the open server and the hosted coordinator can import them
 * — the server registers them in-process and over HTTP, the Worker over its fetch-native MCP.
 *
 * Only the *pure* tools live here: reads, plus `propose_changeset` and `raise_question` (whose write
 * logic is in core). The three that touch the host — `raise_expectation` (a model-backed check),
 * `mark_implemented` and `export_specs` (a filesystem snapshot) — stay in the server and are composed
 * on top of these (see the server's `toolsFor`).
 *
 * The tool objects are plain `SdkMcpToolDefinition`-shaped records (see {@link defineTool}); the agent
 * SDK's `tool()` helper is only a typed constructor for that same shape, so we reproduce it here
 * rather than depend on the SDK.
