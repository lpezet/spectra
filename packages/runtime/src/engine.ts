/**
 * The agent runtime's core loop, with no transport bolted on.
 *
 * This is everything the runtime *is* — running one agent's SDK loop, streaming what it does as
 * events, and blocking on approvals — separated from *how a coordinator reaches it*. It holds the
 * per-session state (open runs, pending approvals, resumable SDK sessions) and exposes three verbs
 * a transport drives it through: `submitTurn`, `submitDecision`, `subscribe`. The HTTP service in
 * {@link ./httpTransport.ts} is one such transport; a coordinator that must dial *out* (a laptop
 * behind NAT reaching a hosted coordinator) is another, and it attaches to this same engine without
 * the loop knowing which.
 *
 * The loop itself is unchanged from when it lived inline with the Express server — it still fetches
 * its profile per run from `SERVER_URL/mcp/<agent>/profile` (so identity comes from the one
 * definition in the Server, not a copy here), still emits into a per-session emitter, and still
 * resolves an approval out of a promise the transport completes. What moved is only the boundary:
 * the `active`-guard + `done` emit that used to sit in the turn handler, and the emitter
 * subscription that used to sit in the stream handler, are now `submitTurn`/`subscribe`, so every
 * transport gets them identically rather than re-implementing the guard.
