/**
 * The server's tool surface: the pure tools from `@spectra/agent-tools`, plus the three that can
 * only run on the host, composed into the set an agent actually gets.
 *
 * The pure tools (reads, propose_changeset, raise_question) moved into `@spectra/agent-tools` so the
 * hosted coordinator can serve them too. The three here stay because each reaches something a Worker
 * has not got: `raise_expectation` runs a model-backed check (the agent SDK), and `mark_implemented`
 * / `export_specs` read and write the committed specs snapshot on disk. They are defined in the same
 * `ToolDef` shape and appended to the pure set, so from the agent's side there is one flat tool list.
 *
 * `toolsFor` is unchanged from a caller's view — same signature, same `mcp__blueprints__` names — so
 * the runner and the MCP HTTP route need no change. The version stamp every result carries is now
 * injected (`withVersion`): here it is read from the filesystem snapshot via `currentSnapshot`.
