/**
 * Coverage, meaning "did we think about this thing's lifecycle" — not "is it correct".
 *
 * Nothing here judges an implementation. A term with five expectations is a term someone
 * thought about five times, which is not the same as a term that works. What this answers is
 * narrower and more useful: we named `RecurringTask` and gave it attributes, but did anyone
 * ever say what should happen when a Project holding one is deleted? That question has a
 * yes-or-no answer computable from the glossary, and an empty answer is a real gap whether or
 * not the code happens to do the right thing.
 *
 * The unit is therefore the **pair**, not the term. Counting expectations per term would have
 * called `RecurringTask` covered from the day q-002 landed — it had expectations about
 * completion — while the hole sat in its interaction with deletion. q-004 is exactly that
 * hole, and it took a second implementation pass to find:
 *
 *     deleteProject --ref:Project--> Project <--Task.project-- Task <--parent-- RecurringTask
 *
 * Two hops, one of them traversed backwards, plus a subtype step. Nobody sees that by reading
 * a file, which is the entire argument for computing it.
 *
 * Distance is reported rather than filtered on, because it sorts the work. Pairs at distance 1
 * are usually already covered by the prose — the function's own spec names the entity it
 * takes. The ones at 2 and beyond are where the questions come from.
