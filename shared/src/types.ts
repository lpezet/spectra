/**
 * What someone should be able to expect, stated outside the prose.
 *
 * A Term says what something *is*; an Expectation says what *happens* in a specific case.
 * Both are normative, and keeping them apart buys three things the prose cannot:
 *
 * - Expectations accumulate. Using the app turns up scenarios nobody thought of the first
 *   time, and adding one must not mean rewriting a definition that was already correct.
 * - They are addressable. An id is what lets a test name cite one, a QA agent resolve one,
 *   and a review notice two that say the same thing.
 * - They are countable against the vocabulary, which is what makes coverage computable —
 *   see `coverage.ts`.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a Term. A Term is roughly a class, a thing the product has; an
 * Expectation is a statement about the vocabulary rather than part of it. Making it a
 * `TermType` would hand it a parent, attributes, a slot in the glossary browser beside Task,
 * and a demand for an `implements:` marker — none of which mean anything here. It sits in the
 * same tier as Question and Changeset: first-class, references terms, is not one.
